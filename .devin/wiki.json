      "content": "Ma-Dai-Shi iO is a quasi-linear indistinguishability obfuscation implementation based on the Ma-Dai-Shi 2025 paper. The project has three main parts: (1) Rust core library in src/, (2) Lean 4 formal verification in lean/, and (3) Honeypot demo application in honeypot-demo/. The Rust library implements the full iO construction with LiO, SEH, FHE, PRF, and padding. The Lean formalization proves the main security theorem with 0 sorries and 1 documented axiom.",

The lio.rs module implements Local iO with encrypted gate tables and MAC verification. The hybrid.rs module implements hybrid security experiments for the security proof.",

The demo shows BIP-39 seed phrase validation with double-layer privacy (iO hides the validator, zkSNARK hides which seed was found).",
